This library started at February of 2011 as my Bachelor thesis
in the <a href="http://www.uoa.gr">University of Athens</a> at the
<a href="http://www.di.uoa.gr">Deparment of Informatics and Telecomunications</a>.
My supervisors are <a href="http://www.di.uoa.gr/~emiris">Ioannis EMIRIS</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/christodoulosfragoudakis/">Christodoulos FRAGOUDAKIS</a>.
It is designed in order to be used from the students of the computational geometry
course at the same department. Because the previous methods was difficult to be
installed and maintained, the desicion of making a new library from scratch, was made.

<p>
We used Python because it is really easy to transform pseudo code to a well designed
program ready to be executed in every machine.
</p>
<p>
I have tried to imitate CGAL because it is the best existing library we know.
I tried to have the same names of the functions. Hence it will be easy for 
someone that had used CGAL to do the same things with this library.
</p>
<p>
EucleiDIs uses the <a href="http://www.vpython.org">VPython</a> (it can be easily installed in *NIX based systems
and with little effort to Windows) library to take the simple objects it needs (points as spheres, ...).
</p>
<p>
Trying to have backward compatibility with the VPython the only mouse button we use is the right one.
In the newer versions of VPython the other buttons are used for altering the scene (zoom in -out, spin)
</p>
<p>
EucleiDIs uses the Decimal library of python in order to have better precision than CGAL. This will give
the opportunity to have better results in high precision examples. Thus the coordinates of Points_2
( the basic class of all the others) are stored as Decimal numbers. The library offers every mathematical
function so we do not have to implement anything different for running EucleiDIs.
